Define a procedure fourth that computes the fourth power of its argument. Do this two ways, first using 
the multiplication function, and then using square and not (directly) using multiplication

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (fourth x)
  (* x x x x))

(define (fourth x)
  (* (square x) (square x)))
